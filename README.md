For this assignment I wrote three html files and two CSS files. The html files are index.html, resume.html, and bio.html. The CSS files are style.css and bio_style.css. The resume.html makes use of the style.css as a style sheet and the other two html files make use of bio_style.css as a style_sheet. The index.html correctly serves as my homepage on github and links to the other html files. And I also have an index.html page hosted in my Tufts CS account that redirects to my actual website on GitHub. This work took approximately 3 hours to complete. I got help from a TA linking the index.html on my Tufts CS account to my actual GitHub page and I collaborated with Maxwell Ekechukwu.
